## Welcome

This is a portfolio that reflects my interests. 

### Software Developing

When I was in 10th grade, I started learning to code using the Swift language. I am currently working on Munch POS, Learning App, Find my Pets, and Hubble App.

### Newspaper

Here are some newspaper layout that I helped create using InDesign along with other Adobe Suite programs

### Video Production

The first project I worked on was a music video for the song "Fake" by Ranger in May 2021. I was the Director's Assistant and Production Assistant for Anti-Matter Productions. On the music video set, I got an opportunity to work with Dance Mom's Abby Lee Miller.
